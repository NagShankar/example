This is the least cost option for both builder and buyer.</li>						   <li>Build only with Engineered Hollow Blocks.</li>						   <li>Build sump tanks with dimension 12 x 12 x 20 ft (L x W x D) . This would be 80,000 Litres of water. Harvest rain into this Tank.If full at the end of the rainy season, will sustain a family of 5 for 90 days minimum. Off the Government Water Grid !!!</li>						   <li>Build another Sump Tank with dimension 5 x 5 x 6 ft which can house 4000 Litres. Harvest water from Kitchen and Hand Wash into this. Treat water with bio-remediation. Use this for gardening and flushing toilets.</li>						   <li>Paint Roof and External Walls with Heat Shield. Combination of this with Hollow Blocks will ensure comfortable ambient temperature. No AC required at all.</li>						   <li> Plant Jackfruit, Guava, Neem and 'Gasagasay" Trees around House if there is space.</li>						   <li>Design the House with a Solar Power Plant. Such as Borg Astra series. Various range offered. Check out www.borgenergy.com.
